                                        When we opened Cooking Bird in June 2017, our vision was to
                                        create an unassuming watering hole for the locals. In a town
                                        with endless options for bars and lounges, we found it
                                        challenging to find a friendly bar with a solid craft beer
                                        list, good food, and non-gaming/non-smoking. We wanted to
                                        provide friends and neighbors alike with the original form
                                        of social networking; a fun easy going bar, and a cold pint.
                                        Our staunch belief in providing exceptional quality products
                                        with friendly service in a clean and welcoming setting has
                                        helped us earn the reputation among the locals as one of the
                                        best hidden gems in Las Vegas. Cooking Bird is the
                                        culmination of giving our best to the community by providing
                                        great food, service, and atmosphere. Tucked inside one of
                                        the premier breweries in Nevada, this collaboration project
                                        allows us another opportunity to create a memorable setting
                                        for you to catch up with friends and make new ones over
                                        tasty bites and a refreshing beer.
